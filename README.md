# R Exposure Workshop

[View the website here](https://clanfear.github.io/r_exposure_workshop/)

This is the repository for the R Exposure course in UW Tacoma's Foundations for Business Analytics series. It contains all course content and the website itself. This course is derived from my UW Seattle course [CSSS508: Introduction to R for Social Scientists](https://clanfear.github.io/CSSS508).
