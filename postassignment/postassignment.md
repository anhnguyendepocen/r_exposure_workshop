# Exposure to R
## Post-Assignment

This page describes all components of the R Exposure course you are expected to complete *after the lectures on Saturday, September 28th*. You have three tasks: 

1. Read additional sections from R for Data Science
2. Read a series of introductions to special R topics
3. Complete a template-based programming assignment

Please complete all components by 11:59 PM on October 4th. You will receive feedback on your completed assignment. The assignment also contains basic questions about the first two tasks.

### [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

R for Data Science is an introduction programming in R using the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). While not the only way to use R--or optimal in every situation--the Tidyverse is intuitive, powerful, and widely used. For this task, I ask that you **read the following chapters of R for Data Science** and attempt to **execute the code shown in your own RStudio**. You are likely to feel confused and overwhelmed. That is fine--programming is learned by trial-and-error! If you don't understand a section or particular set of code, it is fine to return to it later--or reach out to me with your questions.

**Your assignment: [Chapters 1 through 3](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).**

In the future, I would encourage you to read and work through the entire text--it is an excellent introduction to using R for data science.
