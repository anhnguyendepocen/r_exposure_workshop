# Exposure to R
## Post-Assignment

This page describes all components of the R Exposure course you are expected to complete *after the lectures on Saturday, September 28th*. You have three tasks: 

1. Read additional sections from R for Data Science
2. Read two introductions to special R topics
3. Complete two (or more) RStudio Primers

You may note that all post-assignments are existing content from other providers and are not handed in to me. There are many great R resources online--you should become accustomed to using multiple platforms to continue learning about R. I do not ask for proof of completion of any tasks: If this content is useful to you, you'll complete it and more; if not, you're not forced to work through it.

### [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

R for Data Science is an introduction programming in R using the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). While not the only way to use R--or optimal in every situation--the Tidyverse is intuitive, powerful, and widely used. For this task, I ask that you read chapters 1 through 3 of R for Data Science** and attempt to **execute the code shown in your own RStudio**. You are likely to feel confused and overwhelmed. That is fine--programming is learned by trial-and-error! If you don't understand a section or particular set of code, it is fine to return to it later--or reach out to me with your questions. In the future, I would encourage you to read and work through the entire text--it is an excellent introduction to using R for data science.

## Special Topics

### [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)

R Markdown is possibly the most useful and powerful capability of the R platform. It enables you to seamlessly weave together R code and written text to produce fully reproducible journal articles, memos, reports, books, websites, and slides (including those seen in this course). You should watch the introduction video then read through the entire introduction linked here (browse through in on the left).

### [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)

[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is an R package for building interactive web applications. It is commonly used in industry for building dashboards for customers or internal users to explore data. Read the main Shiny front page then browse through the Shiny gallery to see examples of Shiny applications. RStudio hosts a comprehensive [Shiny tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) if you want to build similar applications yourself.

## [RStudio Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers)

[RStudio Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers) are interactive R tutorials that run in your browser using RStudio cloud--a fully operational online version of RStudio. I ask that you complete at least the first primer (The Basics). I strongly recommend that if you're planning to use R in the future, you also complete at least Work with Data and Visualize Data as well.
